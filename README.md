Providentia | Python |  Discord bot built for spying and war. Made with SQL and Python using the module discord.py  Uses panda and matplot for data and statistical analysis. Has commands relating to fun and memes, and also facial recognition of discord attachments. More content is planned to be invented for the bot. | Version 3 (Magnata)
Mestre Sara | Python | My most advanced discord bot, it usually gets updated before Providentia. Providentia then takes the light-weight functionalities and gets updated. | Under development
Providentia SpySuite | HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT + Python + Django + React | Web app created to be used with the Discord bot, Providentia. It takes the information gotten from user input and translates it into a friendly interface. | Under development
Scarlett Gateway | HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT + PHP | Web app made to organize my day-to-day life through the use of agendas, automation, reminders and other systems. | Finished. Switched for Lyszt.github.io for blogging and professional reasons, and the daily life functionalities were integrated into Providentia. 
Kairos Praxis | Python (Kivy) |  Insight offers competitor analysis functionalities through a desktop application. Automated web scraping allows it to collect competitor-related data from various online resources, which can then be analyzed and compared within the tool.  | Under development
ToadKeep | Python |  Virtual keyboard where you can copy characters and emoticons from a beautiful UI. Made to solve my keyboard problems. | Finished. (Nothing else to add, I decided to leave for bigger projects)

> "It's disguised. It's camouflaged as a 1963 police telephone box. Every time the TARDIS materializes in a new location, within the first nanosecond of landing, it analyzes the surrounding environment, calculates a twelve-dimensional data map of everything within a thousand-mile radius, and then determines which outer shell would blend in best with the environment... and then it disguises itself as a 1963 police telephone box."
