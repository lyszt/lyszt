> "It's disguised. It's camouflaged as a 1963 police telephone box. Every time the TARDIS materializes in a new location, within the first nanosecond of landing, it analyzes the surrounding environment, calculates a twelve-dimensional data map of everything within a thousand-mile radius, and then determines which outer shell would blend in best with the environment... and then it disguises itself as a 1963 police telephone box."
